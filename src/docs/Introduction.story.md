## Histoire Vuetify Design System

This plugin is meant to be used with [Histoire](https://github.com/histoire-dev/histoire) and adds a Story for [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) to show off the design.

You can customise what is displayed and also add styling for almost all sections. This plugin essentially adds another layer (templates) that contain the details for each Vuetify Variant.

### Disclaimer

This plugin is still in development. Use at your own risk.
